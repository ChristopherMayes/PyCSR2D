# PyCSR2D

This package computes the 2D CSR potential and wake functions defined in "Y. Cai and Yuantao. Ding, PRAB 23, 014402 (2020)". We aim to speed up the wake computation using numerical 2D convolution methods.

The required python packages are "mpmath", "scipy", and "numba". 
Some special functinons also require "quantecon" and "tanh-sinh".
To use GPU, "cupy" needs to be installed too.
